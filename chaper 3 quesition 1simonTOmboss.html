    <h1> Simon Tombosa</h1>

    <p> I always think life is full of choices. The problem lies to pick the right path be the master of
        something you are really good at. I thought studying about medications is the one for me, and I decided to go
        for
        a pharmacy school. I loved it and worked really hard to master the world of chemicals and medications and their
        role
        in mitigating human diseases.
    </p>
    <p>But after working for some years I wanted to go further and discover more. That is why,
        I decided to pursue my graduate studies here in USA. I got really fascinated with the field of Biotech;
        manipulating
        the DNA and study human body at a molecular level. I completed my MS and worked for two years on that field.
        once more, I ended up so much interested in IT and software development which I am so excited to master it. Right now, I
        feel I come to the right place, where I can put all my background together and be a master of something, I am really
        passionate about. Although, to be frank, I have some fear of being jack all trades and master of none.
